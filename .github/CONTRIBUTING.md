# WELCOME TO ANSIBLE GITHUB

Hi! Nice to see you here!

## QUESTIONS ?

Please see the [Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html) for information on how to ask questions on the [mailing lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#mailing-list-information) and IRC.

The GitHub issue tracker is not the best place for questions for various reasons, but both IRC and the mailing list are very helpful places for those things, as the community page explains best.

## CONTRIBUTING ?

By contributing you agree that these contributions are your own (or approved by your employer) and you grant a full, complete, irrevocable copyright license to all users and developers of the project, present and future, pursuant to the license of the project. You can also read the same [CLA](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/contributor_license_agreement.html) on the Ansible docsite.

Please review the [Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html) for more information on contributing to Ansible.

## BUG TO REPORT ?

First and foremost, also check the [Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html).

You can report bugs or make enhancement requests at the [Ansible GitHub issue page](http://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/new/choose) by filling out the issue template that will be presented.

Also please make sure you are testing on the latest released version of Ansible or the development branch; see the [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for details.
