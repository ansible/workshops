[Automation mesh](https://www.ansible.com/blog/whats-new-in-ansible-automation-platform-2.1-automation-mesh) is an overlay network intended to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers. Mesh nodes establish peer-to-peer connections with each other across your existing networks bringing automation closer to the endpoints that need it. 

Automation mesh is already configured and ready to use in your workshop environment.
