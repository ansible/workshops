          <p>It&apos;s a <b>simple automation language</b> that can perfectly describe an IT application infrastructure in Ansible Playbooks.</p>
          <p>It&apos;s an <b>automation engine</b> that runs Ansible Playbooks.</p>
          <p>Ansible Tower is an <b>enterprise framework</b> for controlling, securing  and managing your Ansible automation with a <b>UI and RESTful API</b>.</p>
          <aside class="notes speaker">
            <p>Ansible is an automation platform:
              <ul>
                <li>Playbooks make up the automation language</li>
                <li>The code base is the automation engine.</li>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Ansible has a number of qualities that make it the most rapidly growing automation platform in the world. </p>
              <p><strong>Ansible is simple.</strong> Playbooks are human and machine readable, no special coding skills required &ndash; and even people in your IT organization that don’t know Ansible can read an Ansible playbook and understand what’s happening.</p>
              <p>This simplicity also means that it&rsquo;s easy to install and get started to do real work with it quickly &ndash; usually in just minutes. </p>
              <p>Ansible also works like you think &ndash; tasks are always executed in order. All together, the simplicity ensures that you can get started quickly.</p>
              <p><strong>Ansible is powerful.</strong> Simplicity is great, but to be really useful, you also need the powerful features that ensure you can model even the most complex of IT workflows.</p>
              <p>Ansible is complete automation, able to deploy apps, manage orchestration, and configure the infrastructure, networks, operating systems, and services that you’re already using today. </p>
              <p>Together, Ansible’s capabilities allow you to orchestrate the entire application and environment lifecycle, regardless of where It&apos;s deployed.</p>
              <p><strong>Ansible is Agentless.</strong>  Ansible relies on industry-standard and trusted SSH and WinRM protocols to automate. There are no agents or other software to install, and no additional firewall ports to open. With no need to separately stand up a management infrastructure, Ansible further reduces the activation energy required from your team to start automating today.</p>
              <p>In a world where IT complexity stymies even the most basic of IT tasks, Ansible provides a much needed respite &ndash; and path forward enabling teams to crush productivity-stealing complexity and overhead.</p>

            <p>What can you do with Ansible? Nearly anything. Ansible is the Swiss Army knife of DevOps, capable of handling many powerful automation tasks with the flexibility to adapt to many environments and workflows.</p>
            <p>Many folks like to categorize Ansible as a configuration manager, and although yes, Ansible can do that, it&quot;s just the tip of the iceberg. When you couple configuration management with orchestration, you can start to model complicated multi-tier deployments with ease.</p>
            <p>With Ansible, once someone on your team automates something, everyone on the team now knows how to do it.</p>

          <h1>Installing Ansible</h1>
          <pre><code>
# the most common and preferred way of
# installation
$ sudo pip install ansible

# you will need the EPEL repo configured on
# CentOS, RHEL, or Scientific Linux
$ sudo yum install ansible

# you will need the PPA repo configured on
# Debian or Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install ansible
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>As open source, Ansible is freely-available thru numerous means and can be installed in minutes with only a few requirements that most system already have. The installation methods listed here are the most commonly used.</p>
            <p>Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2.6 or 2.7 installed. Python 3 support is in tech preview as of version 2.2. Windows isn’t supported for the control machine.</p>
            <p>The requirements of nodes being managed by Ansible vary based on the type and access used to work with them. Ansible needs a way to communicate, which is normally ssh or winrm though other means such as RESTful APIs and specialized connection types may be necessary. Linux servers will need Python 2.6 or later. Windows serves need PowerShell 3.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html">the Installation page</a> in the Ansible documentation.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Playbooks are written in YAML and are used to invoke Ansible modules to perform tasks that are executed sequentially i.e top to bottom. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT workflow. Playbooks are like an instruction manual and describe the state of environment.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html">the Playbook page</a> in the Ansible documentation.</p>

            <p>If playbooks are the instruction manual for setting up and managing your infrastructure, Ansible modules are the tools in your toolkit.</p>
            <p>Modules are executable bits of code that operate on hosts; however, we don’t need to understand the underlying implementation to get them to work. Modules do the heavy-lifting in Ansible and abstract users from the complexity of the underlying details.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Continuing our metaphor, plugins are the gears in the engine.</p>
            <p>Plugins are pieces of code that extend Ansible’s core functionality. Ansible ships with a number of handy plugins, and you can easily write your own.</p>
            <p>These are some of the more common plugin types:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Action plugins manage the execution on the controller and deployment of modules to hosts.</li>
            <li>Callback plugins enable you to hook into Ansible events for display or logging purposes.</li>
            <li>Connection plugins define how to communicate with inventory hosts.</li>
            <li>Filters plugins allow you to manipulate data inside Ansible plays and/or templates. This is a Jinja2 feature; Ansible ships extra filter plugins.</li>
            </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Your inventory of hosts are your raw material. They are a list of nodes and associated meta data that Ansible can automate.</p>
            <p>Inventory lists can be built and stored several different ways, including static files, or can be dynamically-generated from an an external source.</p>
            <p>You can also specify variables as part of an inventory list. For instance, set a particular host key that’s needed to log into that system remotely.  Inventories are ultimately lists of things you want to automate across.</p>
            <p>Here in this slide was see an example of a simple static inventory list of three hosts (webserver1, webserver2 and dbserver1) in two groups (web and db).</p>

            <p>In large-scale environment subject to constant change, synchronizing and maintaining inventory statically is tedious and error prone endeavor. That is why Ansible includes support of external sources such as public and private cloud providers and configuration management database (CMDB) systems.</p>

     Sends arbitrary commands to an ios node and returns the results read from the
     device. This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a
     specific condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met. This
     module does not support running commands in configuration mode. Please use
     [ios_config] to configure IOS devices.

          <h1>Modules: Run Commands</h1>
          <p>If Ansible doesn’t have a module that suits your needs there are the “run command” modules:</p><br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>command</b>: Takes the command and executes it on the host. The most secure and predictable.</li>
            <li><b>ios_command</b>: Sends arbitrary commands to an ios node and returns the results read from the device.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><b>NOTE:</b> Unlike standard modules, run commands have no concept of desired state and should only be used as a last resort.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>&quot;Run commands&quot; are what we collectively call these modules that enable users to do commandline operations in different ways. They’re a great catch all mechanism for getting things done, but they should be used sparingly and as a last resort. The reasons are many and varied.</p>
            <p>The overuse of run commands is common amongst those just becoming familiar with Ansible for automating their work. They use <code>shell</code> to fire off a bash command they already know without stopping to look at the Ansible docs. That works well enough initially, but it undermines the value of automating with Ansible and sets things up for problems down the road. <b>As a best practice, always check the hundreds of Ansible shipping modules for what you need and use those first and run commands as a last resort.</b></p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> <code>shell</code> allows for IO redirection such as pipes. This is why It&apos;s best practice to use <code>command</code> unless they need to pipe something. It also best practice to <strong>never</strong> pass user input or variables thru a run command.</p>

          <h1>Inventory</h1>
          <p>Inventory is a collection of hosts (nodes) with associated data and groupings that Ansible can connect and manage.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hosts (nodes)</li>
            <li>Groups</li>
            <li>Inventory-specific data (variables)</li>
            <li>Static or dynamic sources</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We've already discussed inventory in our review of Ansible's key components.</p>
            <p>Inventory consists of hosts, groups, inventory specific data. Inventory can either be static or dynamic.</p>
            <p>Inventory is a collection of the hosts (nodes) with associated metadata and groupings that Ansible can connect and manage. An inventory source can be static files or dynamically retreived from an external system.</p>
            <p>You can specify a different inventory file using the <code>-i &lt;path&gt;</code> option on the commandline or your Ansible configuration file.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Static inventory is the easiest source to get started with. This example shows a static inventory source in It&rsquo;s simplist form &ndash; a single file with a list of IP addresses or hostnames.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Ansible infers a localhost is present even if it is not explictly listed. This is why you can actually run Ansible without a inventory source. Ansible will only be able to operate on the localhost where it is being run.</p>

            <p>The example shown here is a more practical and common example of a static inventory file.</p>
            <p>Static inventory files are expressed in INI format. The headings in brackets are group names, which are used in classifying systems and deciding what systems you are controlling at what times and for what purpose. Hosts can belong to multiple groups and groups can be members of other groups. (The latter is not shown here.)</p>
            <p>NOTE: This example contains variables, a topic we haven't touched on just yet. We'll go into them on the next slide.</p>
            <p>Other noteworthy attributes in our example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>ansible_host</code> is an example of a host variable.</li>
              <li>Hosts can be assigned arbitrary human-meaningful names or aliases such as "control" and "haproxy". Ansible will instead use the value of <code>ansible_host</code> (one of several <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html#magic-variables-and-how-to-access-information-about-other-hosts">&quot;magic&quot; inventory variables</a>) as the network address to connect.</li>
              <li>Static inventory files can support character ranges such as &quot;node-[1:3]&quot;</li>
              <li>Like localhost, Ansible infers an &quot;all&quot; group is present. As its name implies, all inventory hosts are memebers of this group.</li>
              <li>The heading &quot;all:vars&quot; is an example of group variable assignment using two more &quot;magic&quot; variables, <code>ansible_ssh_private_key_file</code> and <code>ansible_user</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This example just covers the basics. There's a lot more to inventory that is not covered here. See the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html">Ansible inventory documentation</a> for more details.</p>

            <p>Facts are bits of information derived from examining a host systems that are stored as variables for later use. An example of this might be the ip address of the host, or what operating system it is running. The facts Ansible will discover about a host is extensive. What's shown here is just a small sample. Run <code>ansible localhost -m setup</code> for a more complete representation.</p>
            <p>Ansible collects facts using the <code>setup</code> module. By default, Ansible will run the <code>setup</code> module before any other tasks are executed in a playbook. These facts can be referenced by subsequent automation tasks on a per host-basis during the playbook run.</p>

            <p>If variables of the same name are defined in multiple sources, they get overwritten in a certain and specific order. This is why this variable precedence is important to understand.</p>
            <p>There are 16 levels of variable precedence as of Ansible 2.x. The <code>extra_vars</code> (passed thru the commandline) always take precedence vs. role defaults which will always get overridden by any other source. The previous inventory example defines vars at 13 and 14 (higlighted in the list) in the variable precedence chain.</p>
            <p>It&apos;s a good idea to limit the different sources where a specific variable is being set. While Ansible's variable precedence handling is comprehensive and well-defined, it can laborious to keep the resolution of multiple sources straight.</p>

            <p>It&apos;s best practice to always name your plays and tasks. Adding name with a human-meaningful description better communicates the intent to users when running a play.</p>

            <p>Here we list a few more though this is still far from all there is. There&apos;s many other powerful playbook features for handling less common though vital automation workflows.

          <h1>Templates</h1>
          <p>Ansible embeds the <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2 templating engine</a> that can be used to dynamically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set and modify play variables</li>
            <li>Conditional logic</li>
            <li>Generate files such as configurations from variables</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Templates are a vital feature provided by the Jinja2 template engine, a powerful piece of software independent of Ansible. Ansible makes this usage as seamless and transparent as possible. Most will not realize they are doing templating when they develop plays with Ansible.</p>
            <p>We don't show any specific template examples at the moment because we'll have plenty of opportunity to see templates in action as we cover other topics.</p>
            <p>In all actuality, what is covered here only touches upon a few of its most basic features. To go deeper see these docs:</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This example demonstrates a basic loop with <code>with_items</code>. The loop sets a variable called &quot;item&quot;, a template variable courtesy of the embedded Jinja2 template engine, with the list value that is in context.</p>
            <p>There are many different and specialized types of task loops to work with. See the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_loops.html">Loops documentation</a> to go deeper.</p>

          <h1>Tags</h1>
          <p>Tags are useful to be able to run a subset of a playbook on-demand.</p>

tasks:
- name: gather ios_facts
  ios_facts:
  register: version
  <mark>tags: debug</mark>

    backup: yes
  <mark>tags: </mark>
    <mark>- backup</mark>
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In the provided example, if the playbook were run with <code>--tags &quot;packages&quot;</code> the yum task would execute and the template task would be skipped. If the playbook were run with <code>--tags &quot;configuration&quot;</code> the opposite would happen. Without a <code>--tags</code> both tasks would execute like normal.</p>
            <p>Tags can be seen as a simple though specialized form of conditional statement designed to enable the execution of a subset tasks. Tags are a bit more than simple boolean flags though.

  when: ansible_network_os == "ios"
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In the provided example we use a block to group two tasks that are to be conditional executed if a host is running a Red Hat family linux using one conditional clause. In practice, we could have copied the <code>when</code> clause onto each task and gotten same result. Using a block, there is less clutter thereby less to maintain and nothing to keep in sync. The utility of using a block increases the more tasks and clauses are in use.</p>
            <p>Blocks have a play in error handling and automating roll backs that we won't get into here given the scope of that topic.</p>
