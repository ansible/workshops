# Demos

These demos are built for https://github.com/ansible/workshops.  To use the demo it is recommended to run the [provisioner](../provisioner/README.md) for the correct **workshop_type**.  By standardizing demos on a Ansible Workshop **workbench** it is easier to test and verify demos are always working.  Feel free re-use any component of this demo but this demo is only supported in this fashion.

| Demo Category   | Brief Description  |
|---|---|
| [ChatOps](chatops)  | The objective of this demo is showcase Ansible integrating with a chat tool like "Slack" as an interface to the managed network devices. |
| [networking](networking)   | Various Ansible Network Automation demos for the `workshop_type: networking`.  These are meant to show off various network automation features and functions.  **Note** There may be other demos that require the `workshop_type: networking` but these are meant to be exclusively "show and tell" for network automation features versus interoperability or integration with another tool. |
| [Ansible + ServiceNow](servicenow)   | These demos are intended for effectively demonstrating Ansible + ServiceNow capabilities with prescriptive guides on the Ansible Automation Workshop infrastructure. |
