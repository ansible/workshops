major_changes:
- Initial release of the ``network-engine`` Ansible role.

  output of structured ASCII text into a JSON data structure that can be
  added to the inventory host facts.
- NEW ``textfsm`` Parses ASCII text into JSON facts using textfsm engine and Google TextFSM-formatted input.
  Provides textfsm rules-based templates to parse data from text. The template acting as parser will iterate of the rules and parse the output of structured ASCII text into a JSON data structure that can be added to the inventory host facts.
