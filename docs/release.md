# Release PR

The Ansible Automation Workshops have two main branches

- `master` - this is the stable supported branch.  This is what RHPDS (Red Hat Product Demo System) points to
- `devel` - this is the development branch.  This is where PRs (Pull Requests) go into, and get tested.

A **release** is when we move `devel` into `master`.  This means the stable `master` branch will pickup all new features, bug fixes and changes that `devel` branch has been testing.

# How to push a release

1. An administrator has to create a PR (pull request) from `devel` into `master` from `https://github.com/ansible/workshops`

  ![release pr](../images/release_pr.png)

2. Title the PR with `Date Release PR`

  For example:
  `April 16th, 2020 Release PR`

3. Copy the last PR's contents into your new PR contents, here is an example: [https://github.com/ansible/workshops/pull/800](https://github.com/ansible/workshops/pull/800)

e.g. here is a template you can use

```

4. The goal of the PR summary is to:

  - indicate this is a release PR
  - link to the last release PR
  - summarize all PRs into `devel` since the last time there was a release (this means only purple merged PRs, not closed PRs, or PRs still not merged yet)

5. wait for CI testing to complete

   ![ci testing](../images/ci.png)

6. merge when you get passing CI

  ![passed ci](../images/passed.png)

7.  If there are major changes, announce these to Roland to make sure they reach his newsletter :)
