# Intro

In this section we will show you step by step how to add pre commit linting to a repository. You will be able to use this on the command line to lint your code and use it in a github repository. The lab already has git repo created and cloned onto your vscode instance.

## Pre Steps

If you are using the Workshop, a Workshop project should be available in your VSCode for you to push to the Workshop Gitea server. Create the files in this project folder.

<mark style="background-color: yellow">NOTE: If when you click on the Explorer tab that looks like two pieces of paper and you see "Open Folder" click on that. In the popup window click windows-workshop/workshop_project/ (full path is: `/home/student/windows-workshop/workshop_project`) then click "ok". If prompted select the check box and "Yes, I trust the authors" option. You should now see a readme that has a typo saying Welcome to Windows Automation workshop.</mark>

## Step 1

Ensure that you have `pre-commit` installed on your machine. On the VScode toolbar you should see `Terminal` then in the dropdown select `New Terminal`.

```console
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo pip3.9 install pre-commit
```

NOTE: Normally we would suggest `dnf install pre-commit` but in this lab we will have to use pip3

Next, configure pre-commit to a pre-hook action.

```console
pre-commit install
```

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [Pre-commit installation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation)

## Step 2

Create a file that links to the pre-commit hooks that you want to use. In our case, some general cleanup hooks, yamllint, and ansible-lint.

Create a file in this folder path `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
---
repos:
  - repo: 'https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks'
    rev: v4.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace
  - repo: 'https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint.git'
    rev: v6.16.2
    hooks:
      - id: ansible-lint
        pass_filenames: false
        always_run: true
        entry: "ansible-lint"
        args:
          - "--profile=production"
        additional_dependencies:
          - "ansible-core>=2.13"
          - "yamllint>=1.26,<2.0"
...

```

Create a yaml lint file `.yamllint.yml` to hold our yaml rules.

```yaml
---
extends: default

ignore: |
  changelogs
  vault.yml
rules:
  # 80 chars should be enough, but don't fail if a line is longer
  line-length: disable
  colons:
    max-spaces-before: 0
    max-spaces-after: -1
  document-end:
    present: true
  document-start:
    present: true
  indentation:
    level: error
    # Require indentation https://redhat-cop.github.io/automation-good-practices/#_yaml_and_jinja2_syntax
    spaces: 2
    indent-sequences: true
    check-multi-line-strings: false
  truthy:
    level: error
    # Allow only YAML 1.2 booleans https://redhat-cop.github.io/automation-good-practices/#_yaml_and_jinja2_syntax
    allowed-values:
      - 'true'
      - 'false'
...

```

- [pre-commit config](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---top-level)
- [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Step 3

To use this in github set the workflow action in a file.

Create a file in this folder path `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`

```yaml
---
name: Yaml and Ansible Lint

on: [push, pull_request]  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install Collections
        run: |
          sudo apt install software-properties-common
          sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
          sudo apt install ansible
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v2.0.0
...

```

Further documentation for more hooks that can be added can be found here:

- [Supported hooks](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html)

## Step 4

Now lets create some git files.

Create a file `.gitignore` which we will use to tell git to not include some files.

```text
.password
ansible.cfg
ansible-navigator.log
*.json
```

Next let's create a `.gitattributes` file

```text
*.yml linguist-detectable
*.yaml linguist-detectable
```

Further documentation for more hooks that can be added can be found here:

- [git ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
- [git attributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes)
- [github linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/docs/how-linguist-works.md)

## Step 5

Commit your current work so far. (note we won't mention it again but you should commit and push at the end of each section)

```console
git add .
git commit -am "task0 complete"
git push origin master
```

NOTE: It is likely you will get a failed commit the first attempt due to end of line auto fixes taking place, if this happens just run the commit again and everything should be green.

NOTE: also if you get an error about credential helper run `git config --global --unset credential.helper` and then do your commit again.
