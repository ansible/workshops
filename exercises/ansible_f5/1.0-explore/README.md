### Section 1: Exploring the lab environment

Before you get started, please join us on slack! [Click here to join the ansiblenetwork slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ansiblenetwork/shared_invite/enQtMzEyMTcxMTE5NjM3LWIyMmQ4YzNhYTA4MjA2OTRhZDQzMTZkNWZlN2E3NzhhMWQ5ZTdmNmViNjk2M2JkYzJjODhjMjVjMGUxZjc2MWE).  This will allow you to chat with other network automation engineers and get help after the workshops concludes.

#### Step 1

Navigate to the `networking-workshop` directory.

```
[student1@ansible ~]$ cd networking-workshop/
[student1@ansible networking-workshop]$
```

#### Step 2

Run the `ansible` command with the `--version` command to look at what is configured:

```
[student1@ansible networking-workshop]$ ansible --version
ansible 2.6.2
  config file = /home/student1/.ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/student1/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, May  3 2017, 07:55:04) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-14)]
```

> Note: The Ansible version you see might differ from the above output


This command gives you information about the version of Ansible, location of the executable, version of Python, search path for the modules and location of the `ansible configuration file`.

#### Step 3

Use the `cat` command to view the contents of the `ansible.cfg` file.


```
[student1@ansible networking-workshop]$ cat ~/.ansible.cfg
[defaults]
connection = smart
timeout = 60
inventory = /home/student1/networking-workshop/lab_inventory/hosts
host_key_checking = False
private_key_file = /home/student1/.ssh/aws-private.pem
[student1@ansible networking-workshop]$

```

Note the following parameters within the `ansible.cfg` file:

 - `inventory`: shows the location of the ansible inventory being used
 - `private_key_file`: this shows the location of the private key used to login to devices

#### Step 4

The scope of a `play` within a `playbook` is limited to the groups of hosts declared within an Ansible **inventory**. Ansible supports multiple [inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html) types. An inventory could be a simple flat file with a collection of hosts defined within it or it could be a dynamic script (potentially querying a CMDB backend) that generates a list of devices to run the playbook against.

In this lab you will work with a file based inventory written in the **ini** format. Use the `cat` command to view the contents of your inventory:

`[student1@ansible networking-workshop]$ cat lab_inventory/hosts`

The output will look as follows with student2 being the respective student workbench:
```
[all:vars]
ansible_user=student2
ansible_ssh_pass=ansible
ansible_port=22

[lb]
f5 ansible_host=34.199.128.69 ansible_user=admin private_ip=172.16.26.136 ansible_ssh_pass=admin

[control]
ansible ansible_host=107.23.192.217 ansible_user=ec2-user private_ip=172.16.207.49

[webservers]
host1 ansible_host=107.22.141.4 ansible_user=ec2-user private_ip=172.16.170.190
host2 ansible_host=54.146.162.192 ansible_user=ec2-user private_ip=172.16.160.13
```

#### Step 5

In the above output every `[ ]` defines a group. For example `[webservers]` is a group that contains the hosts `host1` and `host2`.

> Note: A group called **all** always exists and contains all groups and hosts defined within an inventory.


We can associate variables to groups and hosts. Host variables are declared/defined on the same line as the host themselves. For example for the host `f5`:

```
f5 ansible_host=34.199.128.69 ansible_user=admin private_ip=172.16.26.136 ansible_ssh_pass=admin
```

 - `f5` - The name that Ansible will use.  This can but does not have to rely on DNS
 - `ansible_host` - The IP address that ansible will use, if not configured it will default to DNS
 - `ansible_user` - The user ansible will use to login to this host, if not configured it will default to the user the playbook is run from
 - `private_ip` - This value is not reserved by ansible so it will default to a [host variable](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html#host-variables).  This variable can be used by playbooks or ignored completely.
- `ansible_ssh_pass` - The password ansible will use to login to this host, if not configured it will assume the user the playbook ran from has access to this host through SSH keys.  

> Does the password have to be in plain text?  No, Red Hat Ansible Tower can take care of credential management in an easy to use web GUI or a user may use [ansible-vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/first_inventory.html#protecting-sensitive-variables-with-ansible-vault)
