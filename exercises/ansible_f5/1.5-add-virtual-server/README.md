# Objective

Demonstrate use of the [BIG-IP virtual server module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/bigip_virtual_server_module.html) to configure a virtual server on the BIG-IP. Virtual server is a combination of IP:Port.

# Guide

## Step 1:

Using your text editor of choice create a new file called `bigip-virtual-server.yml`.

```
[student1@ansible ~]$ nano bigip-virtual-server.yml
```

>`vim` and `nano` are available on the control node, as well as Visual Studio and Atom via RDP

## Step 2:

Ansible playbooks are **YAML** files. YAML is a structured encoding format that is also extremely human readable (unlike it's subset - the JSON format).

Enter the following play definition into `bigip-virtual-server.yml`:

``` yaml
---
- name: BIG-IP SETUP
  hosts: lb
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
```

- The `---` at the top of the file indicates that this is a YAML file.
- The `hosts: f5`,  indicates the play is run only on the F5 BIG-IP device
- `connection: local` tells the Playbook to run locally (rather than SSHing to itself)
- `gather_facts: no` disables facts gathering.  We are not using any fact variables for this playbook.

Do not exit the editor yet.

## Step 3

Next, append the `task` to above playbook. This task will use the `bigip-virtual-server` to configure a virtual server on the BIG-IP

<!-- {% raw %} -->

``` yaml
  tasks:

  - name: ADD VIRTUAL SERVER
    bigip_virtual_server:
      provider:
        server: "{{private_ip}}"
        user: "{{ansible_user}}"
        password: "{{ansible_ssh_pass}}"
        server_port: 8443
        validate_certs: no
      name: "vip"
      destination: "{{private_ip}}"
      port: "443"
      enabled_vlans: "all"
      all_profiles: ['http','clientssl','oneconnect']
      pool: "http_pool"
      snat: "Automap"
```

<!-- {% endraw %} -->

>A play is a list of tasks. Tasks and modules have a 1:1 correlation.  Ansible modules are reusable, standalone scripts that can be used by the Ansible API, or by the ansible or ansible-playbook programs. They return information to ansible by printing a JSON string to stdout before exiting.

- `name: ADD VIRTUAL SERVER` is a user defined description that will display in the terminal output.
- `bigip_virtual_server:` tells the task which module to use.
- The `server: "{{private_ip}}"` parameter tells the module to connect to the F5 BIG-IP IP address, which is stored as a variable `private_ip` in inventory
- The `provider:` parameter is a group of connection details for the BIG-IP.
- The `user: "{{ansible_user}}"` parameter tells the module the username to login to the F5 BIG-IP device with
- The`password: "{{ansible_ssh_pass}}"` parameter tells the module the password to login to the F5 BIG-IP device with
- The `server_port: 8443` parameter tells the module the port to connect to the F5 BIG-IP device with
- The `name: "vip"` parameter tells the module to create a virtual server named vip
- The `destination"` parameter tells the module which IP address to assign for the virtual server
- The `port` paramter tells the module which Port the virtual server will be listening on
- The `enabled_vlans` parameter tells the module which all vlans the virtual server is enbaled for
- The `all_profiles` paramter tells the module which all profiles are assigned to the virtuals server
- The `pool` parameter tells the module which pool is assigned to the virtual server
- The `snat` paramter tells the module what the Source network address address should be. In this module we are assigning it to be Automap which means the source address on the request that goes to the backend server will be the self-ip address of the BIG-IP
- The `validate_certs: "no"` parameter tells the module to not validate SSL certificates.  This is just used for demonstration purposes since this is a lab.

Save the file and exit out of editor

## Step 4

Run the playbook - exit back into the command line of the control host and execute the following:

```
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook bigip-virtual-server.yml
```

# Playbook Output

```yaml
[student1@ansible]$ ansible-playbook bigip-virtual-server.yml

# Solution

The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here for an Answer key.  Click here: [bigip-virtual-server.yml](https://github.com/network-automation/linklight/blob/master/exercises/ansible_f5/1.5-add-virtual-server/bigip-virtual-server.yml).

# Verifying the Solution

To see the configured **Virtual Server**, login to the F5 load balancer with your web browser.  

>Grab the IP information for the F5 load balancer from the `/home/studentX/networking_workshop/lab_inventory/hosts` file, and type it in like so: https://X.X.X.X:8443/

Login information for the BIG-IP:
- username: admin
- password: **provided by instructor** defaults to ansible

The load balancer virtual server can be found by navigating the menu on the left.  Click on **Local Traffic**. then click on **Virtual Server**.  See the screenshot below:
![f5 vip image](f5vip.png)

## Verifying the web servers

Each RHEL web server actually already has apache running.  Exercise 1.1 through 1.5 have successfully setup the load balancer for the pool of web servers.  Open up the public IP of the F5 load balancer in your web browser:

>This time use port 443 instead of 8443, e.g. https://X.X.X.X:443/

Each time you refresh the host will change between **node1** and **node2**. Here is animation of the host field changing:
![animation](animation.gif)
>the animation might not work on certain browsers

## Alternate Verification Method

Instead of using a browser window it is also possible to use the command line on the Ansible control node. Use the `curl` command on the **ansible_host** to access public IP or private IP address of F5 load balancer in combination with the `--insecure` and `--silent` command line arguments.  Since the entire website is loaded on the command line it is recommended to `| grep` for the student number assigned to the respective workbench. (e.g. student5 would `| grep student5`)

```
[studentX@ansible ~]$ curl https://172.16.26.136:443 --insecure --silent | grep studentX
    <p>F5TEST-studentX-node1</p>
[studentX@ansible ~]$ curl https://172.16.26.136:443 --insecure --silent | grep studentX
    <p>F5TEST-studentX-node2</p>
[studentX@ansible ~]$ curl https://172.16.26.136:443 --insecure --silent | grep studentX
    <p>F5TEST-studentX-node1</p>
```
