# Objective

Demonstrate building a virtual server (exactly like the Section 1 Ansible F5 Exercises) with F5 AS3

  - Learn about AS3 ([Application Services 3 Extension](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/userguide/about-as3.html)) declarative model.  It is not the intention of this exercise to learn AS3 thoroughly, but just give some introduction to the concept and show how it easily integrates with Ansible Playbooks.
  - Learn about the [set_fact module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/set_fact_module.html)
  - Learn about the [uri module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/uri_module.html)


# Guide

#### Make sure the BIG-IP configuration is clean, run exercise 1.6-delete-configuration before proceeding

## Step 1:

Make sure the F5 BIG-IP has AS3 enabled.  

  1. Login to the F5 BIG-IP through your web browser.  
  2. Click on the iApps button on the lefthand menu.  
  3. Click the `Package Management LX` Link
  4. Make sure that `f5-appsvcs` is installed.  

If this is not working please ask your instructor for help.

## Step 2:

Before starting to build a Playbook, its important to understand how AS3 works.  AS3 requires a JSON template to be handed as an API call to F5 BIG-IP.  **The templates are provided** for this exercise.  You do not need to fully understand every parameter, or create these templates from scratch.  There are two parts->

1. `tenant_base.j2`

{% raw %}

```
{
    "class": "AS3",
    "action": "deploy",
    "persist": true,
    "declaration": {
        "class": "ADC",
        "schemaVersion": "3.2.0",
        "id": "testid",
        "label": "test-label",
        "remark": "test-remark",
        "WorkshopExample":{
            "class": "Tenant",
            {{ as3_app_body }}
        }
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

 `tenant_base` is a standard template that F5 Networks will provide to their customers.  The important parts to understand are:

  - `"WorkshopExample": {` - this is the name of our Tenant.  The AS3 will create a tenant for this particular WebApp.  A WebApp in this case is a virtual server that load balances between our two web servers.
  - `"class": "Tenant",` - this indicates that `WorkshopExample` is a Tenant.
  - `as3_app_body` - this is a variable that will point to the second jinja2 template which is the actual WebApp.  

----

2. `as3_template.j2`

{% raw %}
```
"web_app": {
    "class": "Application",
    "template": "http",
    "serviceMain": {
        "class": "Service_HTTP",
        "virtualAddresses": [
            "{{private_ip}}"
        ],
        "pool": "app_pool"
    },
    "app_pool": {
        "class": "Pool",
        "monitors": [
            "http"
        ],
        "members": [
            {
                "servicePort": 443,
                "serverAddresses": [
                    {% set comma = joiner(",") %}
                    {% for mem in pool_members %}
                        {{comma()}} "{{  hostvars[mem]['ansible_host']  }}"
                    {% endfor %}

                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}


This template is a JSON representation of the Web Application.  The important parts to note are:

- There is a virtual server named `serviceMain`.
  - The template can use variables just like tasks do in previous exercises.  In this case the virtual IP address is the private_ip from our inventory.
- There is a Pool named `app_pool`
  - The jinja2 template can use a loop to grab all the pool members (which points to our web servers group that will be elaborated on below).

**In Summary** the `tenant_base.j2` and `as3_template.j2` create one single JSON payload that represents a Web Application.  We will build a Playbook that will send this JSON payload to a F5 BIG-IP.

**COPY THESE TEMPLATES TO YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY**

```
mkdir j2
cp ~/networking-workshop/3.0-as3-intro/j2/* j2/
```

## Step 3:

Using your text editor of choice create a new file called `as3.yml`:

>`vim` and `nano` are available on the control node, as well as Visual Studio and Atom via RDP

## Step 4:

Enter the following play definition into `as3.yaml`:

{% raw %}

``` yaml
---
- name: LINKLIGHT AS3
  hosts: lb
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    pool_members: "{{ groups['webservers'] }}"
```
{% endraw %}

- The `---` at the top of the file indicates that this is a YAML file.
- The `hosts: lb`,  indicates the play is run only on the lb group.  Technically there only one F5 device but if there were multiple they would be configured simultaneously.
- `connection: local` tells the Playbook to run locally (rather than SSHing to itself)
- `gather_facts: false` disables facts gathering.  We are not using any fact variables for this playbook.

This section from above...
```
  vars:
    pool_members: "{{ groups['webservers'] }}"
```
...sets a variable named `pool_members`, to the webservers group.  There are two webservers on the workbench, `host1` and `host2`.  This means that the `pool_members` variable refers to a list of two webservers.

## Step 5

**Append** the following to the as3.yml Playbook.  

```
  tasks:

  - name: CREATE AS3 JSON BODY
    set_fact:
      as3_app_body: "{{ lookup('template', 'j2/as3_template.j2', split_lines=False) }}"
```

The module [set_fact module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/set_fact_module.html) allows a Playbook to create (or override) a variable as a task within a Play.  This can be used to create new facts on the fly dynamically that didn't exist until that point in the Play.  In this case the [template lookup plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/lookup/template.html) is being used.  This task
  1. renders the j2/as3_template.j2 jinja template that is provided.
  2. creates a new fact named `as3_app_body` that is just JSON text.


## Step 6

**Append** the following to the as3.yaml Playbook.  This task uses the uri module which is used to interact with HTTP and HTTPS web services and supports Digest, Basic and WSSE HTTP authentication mechanisms.  This module is extremely common and very easy to use.  The workshop itself (the Playbooks that provisioned the workbenches) uses the uri module to configure and license Red Hat Ansible Tower.

{% raw %}

```
  - name: PUSH AS3
    uri:
      url: "https://{{ ansible_host }}:8443/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare"
      method: POST
      body: "{{ lookup('template','j2/tenant_base.j2', split_lines=False) }}"
      status_code: 200
      timeout: 300
      body_format: json
      force_basic_auth: yes
      user: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      password: "{{ ansible_ssh_pass }}"
      validate_certs: no
    delegate_to: localhost
```

{% endraw %}


Explanation of parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>parameter</th>
    <th>explanation</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>- name: PUSH AS3</code></td>
    <td>human description of Playbook task, prints to terminal window</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>uri:</code></td>
    <td>this task is calling the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/uri_module.html">uri module</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>url: "https://{{ ansible_host }}:8443/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare"</code></td>
    <td>webURL (API) for AS3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>method: POST</code></td>
    <td>HTTP method of the request, must be uppercase.  Module documentation page has list of all options.  This could also be a <code>DELETE</code> vs a <code>POST</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>body: "{{ lookup('template','j2/tenant_base.j2', split_lines=False) }}"</code></td>
    <td>This sends the combined template (the <code>tenant_base.j2</code> which contains <code>as3_template.j2</code>) and is passed as the body for the API request.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>status_code: 200</code></td>
    <td>A valid, numeric, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status code</a> that signifies success of the request. Can also be comma separated list of status codes.  200 means OK, which is a standard response for successful HTTP requests</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The rest of the parameters are for authentication to the F5 BIG-IP and fairly straight forward (similar to all BIG-IP modules).


## Step 7
Run the playbook - exit back into the command line of the control host and execute the following:

```
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook as3.yaml
```

# Playbook Output

The output will look as follows.

```yaml
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook as3.yml

PLAY [Linklight AS3] ***********************************************************

TASK [Create AS3 JSON Body] ****************************************************
ok: [f5]

TASK [Push AS3] ****************************************************************
ok: [f5 -> localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
f5                         : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```
