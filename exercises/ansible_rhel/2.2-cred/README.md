# Objective

Explore and understand the lab environment.  This exercise will cover
- Locating and understanding:
  - Ansible Tower [**Inventory**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html)
  - Ansible Tower [**Credentials**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html)
- Running ad hoc commands via the Ansible Tower web UI

# Guide

## Examine an Inventory

The first thing we need is an inventory of your managed hosts. This is the equivalent of an inventory file in Ansible Engine. There is a lot more to it (like dynamic inventories) but let’s start with the basics.

  - You should already have the web UI open, if not: Point your browser to the URL you were given, similar to **https://student\<X\>.workshopname.rhdemo.io** (replace "\<X\>" with your student number and "workshopname" with the name of your current workshop) and log in as `admin`. The password will be provided by the instructor.

There will be one inventory, the **Workshop Inventory**. Click the **Workshop Inventory** then click the **Hosts** button

The inventory information at `~/lab_inventory/hosts` was pre-loaded into the Ansible Tower Inventory as part of the provisioning process.

```bash
$ cat ~/lab_inventory/hosts
[all:vars]
ansible_user=student<X>
ansible_ssh_pass=PASSWORD
ansible_port=22

[web]
node1 ansible_host=22.33.44.55
node2 ansible_host=33.44.55.66
node3 ansible_host=44.55.66.77

[control]
ansible ansible_host=11.22.33.44
```
> **Warning**
>
> In your inventory the IP addresses will be different.

## Machine Credentials

One of the great features of Ansible Tower is to make credentials usable to users without making them visible. To allow Tower to execute jobs on remote hosts, you must configure authentication credentials.

> **Note**
>
> This is one of the most important features of Tower: **Credential Separation**\! Credentials are defined separately and not with the hosts or inventory settings.

As this is an important part of your Tower setup, why not make sure that connecting to the managed nodes from Tower is working?

 To access the Tower host via SSH do the following:

- Login to your Tower control host via SSH: `ssh student<X>@student<X>.workshopname.rhdemo.io`
- Replace **workshopname** by the workshop name provided to you, and the `<X>` in `student<X>` by the student number provided to you.
- From the Ansible Tower control node, SSH into `node1` or one of the other nodes (look up the IP addresses from the inventory) and execute `sudo -i`.
- For the SSH connection use the node password from the inventory file, `sudo -i` works without password.

```
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ ssh student<X>@22.33.44.55
student<X>@22.33.44.55's password:
Last login: Thu Jul  4 14:47:04 2019 from 11.22.33.44
[student<X>@node1 ~]$ sudo -i
[root@node1 ~]#
```

What does this mean?

  - Ansible Tower user **student\<X>** can connect to the managed hosts with password based SSH

  - User **student\<X>** can execute commands on the managed hosts as **root** with `sudo`

## Examine Machine Credentials

Now we will examine the credentials to access our managed hosts from Tower.  As part of the provisioning process for this Ansible Workshop the **Workshop Credential** has already been setup.

In the **RESOURCES** menu choose **Credentials**. Now click on the **Workshop Credential**.

Note the following information:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Credential Type</td>
    <td><code>Machine</code>- Machine credentials define ssh and user-level privilege escalation access for playbooks. They are used when submitting jobs to run playbooks on a remote host.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>username</td>
    <td><code>ec2-user</code> which matches our command-line Ansible inventory username for the other linux nodes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SSH PRIVATE KEY</td>
    <td><code>ENCRYPTED</code> - take note that you can't actually examine the SSH private key once someone hands it over to Ansible Tower</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Run Ad Hoc commands

It is possible to run run ad hoc commands from Ansible Tower as well.

  - In the web UI go to **RESOURCES → Inventories → Workshop Inventory**

  - Click the **HOSTS** button to change into the hosts view and select the three hosts by ticking the boxes to the left of the host entries.

  - Click **RUN COMMANDS**. In the next screen you have to specify the ad hoc command:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MODULE</td>
      <td>MACHINE CREDENTIAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ping</td>
      <td>Workshop Credentials</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  - Click **LAUNCH**, and watch the output.

<hr>

The simple **ping** module doesn’t need options. For other modules you need to supply the command to run as an argument. Try the **command** module to find the userid of the executing user using an ad hoc command.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MODULE</td>
      <td>command</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ARGUMENTS</td>
      <td>id</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

> **Tip**
>
> After choosing the module to run, Tower will provide a link to the docs page for the module when clicking the question mark next to "Arguments". This is handy, give it a try.

<hr>

How about trying to get some secret information from the system? Try to print out */etc/shadow*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MODULE</td>
    <td>command</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ARGUMENTS</td>
    <td>cat /etc/shadow</td>
  </tr>
</table>


> **Warning**
>
> **Expect an error\!**

Oops, the last one didn’t went well, all red.

Re-run the last ad hoc command but this time tick the **ENABLE PRIVILEGE ESCALATION** box.

As you see, this time it worked. For tasks that have to run as root you need to escalate the privileges. This is the same as the **become: yes** used in your Ansible Playbooks.

## Challenge Lab: Ad Hoc Commands

Okay, a small challenge: Run an ad hoc to make sure the package "tmux" is installed on all hosts. If unsure, consult the documentation either via the web UI as shown above or by running `[ansible@tower ~]$ ansible-doc yum` on your Tower control host.

> **Warning**
>
> **Solution below\!**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>yum</td>
    <td>command</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ARGUMENTS</td>
    <td>name=tmux</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ENABLE PRIVILEGE ESCALATION</td>
    <td>✓</td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Tip**
>
> The yellow output of the command indicates Ansible has actually done something (here it needed to install the package). If you run the ad hoc command a second time, the output will be green and inform you that the package was already installed. So yellow in Ansible doesn’t mean "be careful"…​ ;-).
