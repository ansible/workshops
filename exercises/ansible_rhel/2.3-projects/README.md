## Objective

An Ansible automation controller **Project** is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks. You can manage your playbooks by placing them into a source code management (SCM) system supported by automation controller such as Git or Subversion.

This exercise covers:

* Understanding and using an Ansible automation controller Project
* Using Ansible playbooks stored in a Git repository.
* Creating and using an Ansible Job Template

## Guide

### Setup Git Repository

For this demonstration, we will use playbooks stored in a Git repository:

[https://github.com/ansible/workshop-examples](https://github.com/ansible/workshop-examples)

A playbook to install the Apache web server has already been committed to the directory **rhel/apache**, `apache_install.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Apache server installed
  hosts: web

  tasks:
  - name: latest Apache version installed
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest

  - name: latest firewalld version installed
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: firewalld
      state: latest

  - name: firewalld enabled and running
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: firewalld
      enabled: true
      state: started

  - name: firewalld permits http service
    ansible.builtin.firewalld:
      service: http
      permanent: true
      state: enabled
      immediate: yes

  - name: Apache enabled and running
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: httpd
      enabled: true
      state: started
```

> **Tip**
>
> Note the difference from other playbooks you might have written\! Most importantly there is no `become` and `hosts` is set to `all`.

To configure and use this repository as a **Source Control Management (SCM)** system in automation controller you have to create a **Project** that uses the repository

### Create the Project

* Go to **Automation Execution → Projects** click the **Create Project** button. Fill in the form:

 <table>
   <tr>
     <th>Parameter</th>
     <th>Value</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Name</td>
     <td>Workshop Project</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Organization</td>
     <td>Default</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Execution Environment</td>
     <td>Default execution environment</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Source Control Type</td>
     <td>Git</td>
   </tr>
 </table>

 Enter the URL into the Project configuration:

 <table>
   <tr>
     <th>Parameter</th>
     <th>Value</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Source Control URL</td>
     <td><code>https://github.com/ansible/workshop-examples.git</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Options</td>
     <td>Select Clean, Delete, Update Revision on Launch to request a fresh copy of the repository and to update the repository when launching a job.</td>
   </tr>
 </table>

* Click **SAVE**


The new project will be synced automatically after creation. But you can also do this manually: Sync the Project again with the Git repository by going to the **Projects** view and clicking the circular arrow **Sync Project** icon to the right of the Project.

After starting the sync job, go to the **Jobs** view: there is a new job for the update of the Git repository.

### Create a Job Template and Run a Job

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. Job templates are useful to execute the same job many times. So before running an Ansible **Job** from automation controller you must create a **Job Template** that pulls together:

* **Inventory**: On what hosts should the job run?

* **Credentials** What credentials are needed to log into the hosts?

* **Project**: Where is the playbook?

* **What** playbook to use?

Okay, let’s just do that: Go to the **Automation Execution -> Templates** view,click the **Create template** button and choose **Create job template**.

> **Tip**

> Remember that you can often click on magnfying glasses to get an overview of options to pick to fill in fields.

 <table>
   <tr>
     <th>Parameter</th>
     <th>Value</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Name</td>
     <td>Install Apache</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Job Type</td>
     <td>Run</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Inventory</td>
     <td>Workshop Inventory</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Project</td>
     <td>Workshop Project</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Execution Environment</td>
     <td>Default execution environment</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Playbook</td>
     <td><code>rhel/apache/apache_install.yml</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Credentials</td>
     <td>Workshop Credential</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Limit</td>
     <td>web</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Options</td>
     <td>tasks need to run as root so check **Privilege Escalation**</td>
   </tr>
 </table>

* Click **Save**

You can start the job by directly clicking the blue **Launch template** button, or by clicking on the rocket in the Job Templates overview. After launching the Job Template, you are automatically brought to the job overview where you can follow the playbook execution in real time:

Job Details
![job details](images/job_details.png)

Job Run
![job_run](images/job_run.png)

Since this might take some time, have a closer look at all the details provided:

* All details of the job template like inventory, project, credentials and playbook are shown.

* Additionally, the actual revision of the playbook is recorded here - this makes it easier to analyse job runs later on.

* Also the time of execution with start and end time is recorded, giving you an idea of how long a job execution actually was.

* Selecting **Output** shows the output of the running playbook. Click on a node underneath a task and see that detailed information are provided for each task of each node.

After the Job has finished go to the main **Jobs** view: All jobs are listed here, you should see directly before the Playbook run an Source Control Update was started. This is the Git update we configured for the **Project** on launch\!

### Challenge Lab: Check the Result

Time for a little challenge:

* Use an ad hoc command on both hosts to make sure Apache has been installed and is running.

You have already been through all the steps needed, so try this for yourself.

> **Tip**
>
> What about `systemctl status httpd`?


> **Warning**
>
> **Solution Below**

* Go to **Automation Execution → Infrastructure →  Inventories** → **Workshop Inventory**

* In the **Automation Execution → Infrastructure → Inventories → **Workshop Inventory**, select the **Hosts** tab and select `node1`, `node2`, `node3` and click **Run Command**

Within the **Details** window, select **Module** `command`, in **Arguments** type `systemctl status httpd` and click **Next**.

Within the **Execution Environment** window, select **Default execution environment** and click **Next**.

Within the **Credential** window, select **Workshop Credential** and click **Launch**.

> **Tip**
>
> The output of the results is displayed once the command has completed.
