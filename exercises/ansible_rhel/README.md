Ansible is a simple yet powerful IT automation engine for application deployment, configuration management, and orchestration that you can learn quickly.

In the first section of this lab you will learn to use Ansible Engine for automation from the basics up to some more advanced concepts.

The second section of this lab covers Tower and provide the user an overview of what Tower is, how it works and what the benefit of it is.

After finishing this lab you are ready to start using Ansible for your automation requirements.

## Presentations

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the particpants through the entire lab. All concepts are explained when they are introduced.

There is an optional presentation available to support the workshops and explain Automation, the basics of Ansible and the topics of the exercises in more detail:

Also have a look at our Ansible Best Practices Deck:

## Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on multiple factors: the number of participants, how familiar those are with Linux in general and how much discussions are done in between.

Having said that, the exercises themselves should take roughly 4-5 hours. The first section is slightly longer than the second one. The accompanying presentation itself adds another hour.

If your experience is different in schedulung these workshops, please let us know and file an issue.
