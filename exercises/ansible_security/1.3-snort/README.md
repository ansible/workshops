# Exercise 1.3 - Executing the first Snort playbook

## Step 3.1 - Snort

To showcase how to automate a network intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system in a security environment, this lab will take you through managing a Snort IDS instance. Snort analyzes network traffic and compares it against some given rule set.
In this lab, Snort is installed on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine and Ansible interacts with it by accessing the RHEL node over SSH.

## Step 3.2 - Accessing the Snort server

In order to connect to the Snort installation, we need to to find the IP address of the machine it is installed on. First, make sure you are connected to your control host `ansible`. You can then get the IP address of the Snort machine by looking up the information on the inventory file `~/lab_inventory/hosts`. This can be done in a single command:

```bash
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ grep snort ~/lab_inventory/hosts
snort ansible_host=22.333.44.5 ansible_user=ec2-user private_ip=172.16.1.2
```

> **NOTE**
>
> The IP addresses here are for demo purposes and will be different in your case. You have your own dedicated Snort setup in your individual lab environment.

Once you find the IP address, it's time to access the Snort server. The connection uses a SSH key pre-installed on the control host, the user for the Snort server is `ec2-user`. From your control host, access the snort server via:

```bash
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ ssh ec2-user@22.333.44.5
Warning: Permanently added '22.333.44.5' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Mon Aug 26 12:17:48 2019 from h-213.61.244.2.host.de.colt.net
[ec2-user@ip-172-16-1-2 ~]$
```

To verify snort is installed and configured properly, you can call it via sudo and ask for the version:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-16-1-2 ~]$ sudo snort --version

Also, check if the service is actively running via `sudo systemctl`:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-16-1-2 ~]$ sudo systemctl status snort
● snort.service - Snort service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/snort.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)

```

> **NOTE**
>
> It might happen that the snort service is not running. In this demo environment this is not a problem, if that is the case, restart it with `systemctl restart snort` and check the status again. It should be running.

Exit the Snort server now by pressing `CTRL` and `D`, or by typing `exit` on the command line. All further interaction will be done via Ansible from the Ansible control host.

## Step 3.3 - Simple Snort rules

In the most basic capacity, Snort works by reading some rules and acting according to them. In this lab, we will be working with some simple examples of Snort in order to show how to automate this configuration with Ansible. This session is not designed to dive into the specifics of Snort rules and the complexity involved in large setups, however, it is helpful to understand the basic structure of a simple rule so that you are aware of what you are automating.

A rule consists of a rule header and rule options and is saved in files.

The Snort rule header breaks down into:

- an action
- the protocol to look for like TCP
- source information like IP and port
- destination information like IP and port

The Snort rule options are keywords separated by `;` and can be:

- messages to output when a rule matches
- SID, a unique identifier of the rule
- content to search for in the packet payload, for example a suspicious string
- or byte tests to check for binary data
- a revision of the rule
- the severity of the attack, called "priority"
- a pre-defined attack type called "classtype" to better group the rule with other rules
- and others.

Not all options are mandatory, some also only override existing default values.

A Snort rule's outline is as follows:

```
[action][protocol][sourceIP][sourceport] -> [destIP][destport] ( [Rule options] )
```

If you want to learn more about Snort rules, check out the [Snort Rule Infographic](https://www.snort.org/documents/snort-rule-infographic) or dive into the [Snort Users Manual (PDF)](https://www.snort.org/documents/snort-users-manual). If you want to have a look at some real Snort rules you can also access your lab Snort installation and look at the content of the `/etc/snort/rules` directory.

## Step 3.4 - Example playbook

 As discussed earlier, Ansible automation is described in playbooks. Playbooks consist of tasks. Each task uses a module and the module's corresponding parameters to describe the change that needs to be done or the state that is desired.

Ansible releases are shipped with a set of modules, however, in Ansible 2.9 there are no modules to interact with Snort yet. For this reason we wrote a set of modules for managing Snort. This way, we can provide value without having to wait for a new Ansible release. Also, we are able to update our modules faster. This is especially important in the early life of a newly developed module.

These Snort modules are shipped as part of a "role". To better describe a role, think about how you wrote your playbook in the last section. While it is possible to write a playbook in one file as we did earlier, often writing all automation pieces in one place results in creating long, complicated playbooks. On the other hand, the chances are that you will eventually want to reuse the automation pieces you write in your playbook. Therefore, you will need oraganize things in a way to get multiple smaller, more simple playbooks work together. Ansible Roles are the way we achieve this. When you create a role, you deconstruct your playbook into parts and those parts sit in a directory structure.

There are multiple advantages in using roles to write your automation. The most notable is that the complexity and playbook intelligence is hidden from the user. The other important advantage is that roles can be easily shared and re-used.

Back to the Snort use case: as mentioned, the Snort modules are shipped as part of a role. This role is called [ids_rule](https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule). Open the Github repository link in the web browser, click on the [library](https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule/tree/master/library) path. You will find the module `snort_rule.py` there. This module shipped as a part of the ids_rule role, can create and change snort rules.

If you take a closer look at the role you'll see that it comes with a re-usable playbook at [tasks/snort.yml](https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule/blob/master/tasks/snort.yml).

Let's have a look at how this playbook can be re-written to use the roles directly. To do this, we first need to download and install the role on our control host. There are different ways to do this but a very convenient way is the command line tool `ansible-galaxy`. This tool installs roles directly from the archives, Git URLs and from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com). Ansible Galaxy is a community hub for finding and sharing Ansible content. It provides features like rating, quality testing, proper searching and so on. For example, the role mentioned above can be found in Ansible Galaxy at [ansible_security/ids_rule](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible_security/ids_rule).

On your control host, you can use the `ansible-galaxy` tool to download and install ids_rule role with a single command:

```bash
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.ids_rule
- downloading role 'ids_rule', owned by ansible_security
- downloading role from https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule/archive/master.tar.gz
- extracting ansible_security.ids_rule to /home/student<X>/.ansible/roles/ansible_security.ids_rule
- ansible_security.ids_rule (master) was installed successfully
```

As you see the role is installed to the roles default path, `~/.ansible/roles/`.It was prefixed by `ansible_security`, this is the name of the project used for security roles, such as what we are using in this lab.

Now that we have the role installed on our control host, we can use it in a playbook. In order to use the role, open your editor to create a new file, `add_snort_rule.yml`. Add the name `Add Snort rule` and target hosts, here `snort`. Since we need root rights to make any changes on Snort, add the `become` flag so that Ansible would take care of privilege escalation.

```yaml
---
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: yes
```

Next we need to add the variables required by our playbook. The role we are using is written in a way that can work with multiple IDS providers, all the user needs to provide is the name of the IDS and the role will take care of the rest. Since we are managing a Snort IDS, we need to set the value of `ids_provider` variable to `snort`.

```yaml
---
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: yes

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort
```

Next, we need to add the tasks. Tasks are the the components which make the actual changes on the target machines. Since we are using a role, we can simply use a single step in our tasks, `include_role`, to add it to our playbook. In order to make the role suitable for our use case, we add the following task-specific variables:

- the actual rule
- the Snort rules file
- the state of the rule, present or absent

```yaml
---
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: yes

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort

  tasks:
    - name: Add snort password attack rule
      include_role:
        name: "ansible_security.ids_rule"
      vars:
        ids_rule: 'alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Attempted /etc/passwd Attack"; uricontent:"/etc/passwd"; classtype:attempted-user; sid:99000004; priority:1; rev:1;)'
        ids_rules_file: '/etc/snort/rules/local.rules'
        ids_rule_state: present
```

Let's have a quick look at what is happening here. the rule header is `alert tcp any any -> any any`, so we create an alert for tcp traffic from any source to any destination.
The rule options define the human readable Snort message if and when the rule finds a match. `uricontent` which is a specialized version of `content` making it easier to analyze URIs. The `classtype` is set to `attempted-user` which is the default class for "attempted user privilege gain". SID is set to a value high enough for user defined rules. The priority is `1` and finally since this is the first version of this rule we set the revision to `1`.

The other variables, `ids_rules_file` and  `ids_rule_state` provide the user defined location for the rules file and state that the rule should be created if it does not exist already (`present`).

## Step 3.5 - Run the playbook

It is now time to execute the playbook. Call `ansible-playbook` with the playbook name:

```bash
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook add_snort_rule.yml

PLAY [Add Snort rule] *****************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ****************************************************************
ok: [snort]

TASK [Add snort password attack rule] *************************************************

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule : verify required variable ids_provider is defined] ***
skipping: [snort]

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule : ensure ids_provider is valid] ***********************
skipping: [snort]

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule : verify required variable ids_rule is defined] *******
skipping: [snort]

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule : verify required variable ids_rule_state is defined] *
skipping: [snort]

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule : include ids_provider tasks] *************************
included: /home/student1/.ansible/roles/ansible_security.ids_rule/tasks/snort.yml for
snort

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule : snort_rule] *****************************************
changed: [snort]

RUNNING HANDLER [ansible_security.ids_rule : restart snort] ***************************
changed: [snort]

PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************
snort  : ok=4  changed=2  unreachable=0  failed=0  skipped=4  rescued=0  ignored=0
```

As you can see when you run this playbook, there are many tasks executed in addition to adding the rules. For instance, the role reloads the Snort service after the rule is added. Other tasks ensure that the variables are defined and verified.
This yet again highlights the value of using roles. By taking advantage of roles, not only you make your content re-usable but you can also add verification tasks and other important steps and keep them neatly hidden inside the role. The users of the role do not need to know the specifics of how Snort works in order to use this role as part of their security automation.

## Step 3.6 - Verfiy changes

A quick way to check if the rules were written correctly is to SSH to the Snort server and look for the content of the `/etc/snort/rules/local.rules` file.  

Another way is to use Ansible on our control host. To do this we use a different role have written to verify if a Snort rule is in place. This role searches and finds existing rules in Snort and is called [ids_rule_facts](htithub.com/ansible-security/ids_rule_facts).
To use this role, as we did previously, we install it using `ansible-galaxy`:

```bash
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.ids_rule_facts
- downloading role 'ids_rule_facts', owned by ansible_security
- downloading role from https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule_facts/archive/master.tar.gz
- extracting ansible_security.ids_rule_facts to /home/student1/.ansible/roles/ansible_security.ids_rule_facts
- ansible_security.ids_rule_facts (master) was installed successfully
```

Once the role is installed, we create a playbook, `verify_attack_rule.yml` to use it. Set the name of the playbook to something like "Verify Snort rule". The values for hosts, the IDS provider variable and the `become` flag can be set the same as our previous playbook.

```yaml
---
- name: Verify Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: yes

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort
```

Next, we import the role `ids_rule_facts`. We also need to provide a search string to identify the rule we are looking for. In our example, considering the rule we have created, it makes sense to use the `uricontent` rule option for this purpose.

```yaml
---
- name: Verify Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: yes

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort

  tasks:
    - name: import ids_rule_facts
      import_role:
        name: 'ansible_security.ids_rule_facts'
      vars:
        ids_rule_facts_filter: 'uricontent:"/etc/passwd"'
```

And most importantly, we want to be able see what is actually found. The `ids_rule_facts` stores the data it collects as Ansible facts. Ansible facts are information specific to each individual host which can be used in further tasks. Therefore, we add another task to output these facts.

```yaml
---
- name: Verify Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: yes

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort

  tasks:
    - name: import ids_rule_facts
      import_role:
        name: 'ansible_security.ids_rule_facts'
      vars:
        ids_rule_facts_filter: 'uricontent:"/etc/passwd"'

    - name: output rules facts
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts.ids_rules
```

Now let's execute the playbook to verify that our rule is part of the Snort installation:

```bash
[student<X>@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook verify_attack_rule.yml

PLAY [Verify Snort rule] **************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ****************************************************************
ok: [snort]

TASK [ansible_security.ids_rule_facts : collect snort facts] **************************
ok: [snort]

TASK [debugoutput rules facts] ********************************************************
ok: [snort] =>
  ansible_facts.ids_rules:
  - alert tcp and any -> any any (msg:"Attempted /etc/passwd Attack";
  uricontent:"/etc/passwd"; classtype:attempted-user; sid:99000004; priority:1; rev:1;)

PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************
snort  : ok=3  changed=0  unreachable=0  failed=0  skipped=0  rescued=0  ignored=0
```

The last task outputs the rule which was found by the role. As you can see, it is the rule we previously added.

Congratulation! you have completed the first steps of automating Snort with Ansible. Head back to the exercise overview and continue with the next step.
