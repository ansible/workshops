Previous exercises showed you the basics of Ansible playbooks. In the
next few exercises, we are going to teach some more advanced ansible
skills that will add flexibility and power to your playbooks.

Ansible exists to make tasks simple and repeatable. We also know that
not all systems are exactly alike and often require some slight change
to the way an Ansible playbook is run. Enter variables.

Variables are how we deal with differences between your systems,
allowing you to account for a change in port, IP address or directory.

Loops enable us to repeat the same task over and over again. For
example, lets say you want to start multiple services, install several
features, or create multiple directories. By using an ansible loop, you
can do that in a single task.

Handlers are the way in which we restart services. Did you just deploy a
new config file, install a new package? If so, you may need to restart a
service for those changes to take effect. We do that with a handler.

For a full understanding of variables, loops, and handlers; check out
our Ansible documentation on these subjects.

Section 1: Creating the Playbook
================================

To begin, we are going to create a new playbook, but it should look very
familiar to the one you created in exercise 3

Step 1:
-------

Within Visual Studio Code, create a new directory in your git repo and
create a site.yml file.

In the Explorer accordion you should have a *WORKSHOP_PROJECT* section where
you previously made `iis_basic`.

![Student Playbooks](images/5-vscode-existing-folders.png)

Step 2: Create a folder called **iis_advanced** and a file called `site.yml`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hover over the *WORKSHOP_PROJECT* section and click the *New Folder* button

Type `iis_advanced` and hit enter. Now, click that folder so it is
selected.

Right-click the `iis_advanced` folder and select *New File*.

Type `site.yml` and hit enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used
for creating your playbook.

![Empty site.yml](images/5-vscode-create-folders.png)

Step 3:
-------

Add a play definition and some variables to your playbook. These include
addtional packages your playbook will install on your web servers, plus
some web server specific configurations.

    ---
    - hosts: windows
      name: This is a play within a playbook
      vars:
        iis_sites:
          - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test'
            port: '8080'
            path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest'
          - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test 2'
            port: '8081'
            path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest2'
        iis_test_message: "Hello World!  My test IIS Server"

Step 4:
-------

Add a new task called **install IIS**. After writing the playbook, click
`File` &gt; `Save` to save your changes.

      tasks:
        - name: Install IIS
          win_feature:
            name: Web-Server
            state: present

        - name: Create site directory structure
          win_file:
            path: "{{ item.path }}"
            state: directory
          with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

        - name: Create IIS site
          win_iis_website:
            name: "{{ item.name }}"
            state: started
            port: "{{ item.port }}"
            physical_path: "{{ item.path }}"
          with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
          notify: restart iis service

![site.yml part 1](images/5-vscode-iis-yaml.png)

> **Note**
>
> **What is happening here!?**  
>
> - `vars:` You’ve told Ansible the next thing it sees will be a
>   variable name  
>
> - `iis_sites` You are defining a list-type variable called
>   iis\_sites. What follows is a list of each site with it’s related
>   variables  
>
> - `file:` This module is used to create, modify, delete files,
>   directories, and symlinks.
>
> - `{{ item }}` You are telling Ansible that this will expand into a
>   list item. Each item has several variables like `name`, `port`,
>   and `path`.  
>
> - `with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}` This is your loop which is
>   instructing Ansible to perform this task on every `item` in
>   `iis_sites`
>
> - `notify: restart iis service` This statement is a `handler`, so
>   we’ll come back to it in Section 3.

Section 2: Opening Firewall and Deploying Files
===============================================

After that, you will define a task to start the IIS service.

Step 1:
-------

Create a `templates` directory in your project directory and create a
template as follows:

Ensure your **iis_advanced folder** is highlighted and then hover over
the *WORKSHOP_PROJECT* section and click the *New Folder* button

Type `templates` and hit enter. The right-click the *templates* folder and click the *New File* button.

Type `index.html.j2` and hit enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used
for creating your template. Enter the following details:

    <html>
    <body>

      <p align=center><img src='http://docs.ansible.com/images/logo.png' align=center>
      <h1 align=center>{{ ansible_hostname }} --- {{ iis_test_message }}

    </body>
    </html>

![index.html template](images/5-vscode-template.png)

Step 2:
-------

Edit back your playbook, `site.yml`, by opening your firewall ports and
writing the template. Use single quotes for `win_template` in order to
not escape the forward slash.

        - name: Open port for site on the firewall
          win_firewall_rule:
            name: "iisport{{ item.port }}"
            enable: yes
            state: present
            localport: "{{ item.port }}"
            action: Allow
            direction: In
            protocol: Tcp
          with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

        - name: Template simple web site to iis_site_path as index.html
          win_template:
            src: 'index.html.j2'
            dest: '{{ item.path }}\index.html'
          with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

        - name: Show website addresses
          debug:
            msg: "{{ item }}"
          loop:
            - http://{{ ansible_host }}:8080
            - http://{{ ansible_host }}:8081

> **Note**
>
> **So… what did I just write?**
>
> - `win_firewall_rule:` This module is used to create, modify, and
>   update firewall rules. Note in the case of AWS there are also
>   security group rules which may impact communication. We’ve opened
>   these for the ports in this example.
>
> - `win_template:` This module specifies that a jinja2 template is
>   being used and deployed.
>
> - used in Ansible to transform data inside a template expression,
>   i.e. filters.
> 
> - `debug:` Again, like in the `iis_basic` playbook, this task displays the URLs to access the sites we are creating for this exercise


Section 3: Defining and Using Handlers
======================================

There are any number of reasons we often need to restart a
service/process including the deployment of a configuration file,
installing a new package, etc. There are really two parts to this
Section; adding a handler to the playbook and calling the handler after
the a task. We will start with the former.

The `handlers` block should start after a one-level indentation, that
is, two spaces. It should align with the `tasks` block.

Step 1:
-------

Define a handler.

      handlers:
        - name: restart iis service
          win_service:
            name: W3Svc
            state: restarted
            start_mode: auto

> **Note**
>
> **You can’t have a former if you don’t mention the latter**
>
> - `handler:` This is telling the **play** that the `tasks:` are
>   over, and now we are defining `handlers:`. Everything below that
>   looks the same as any other task, i.e. you give it a name, a
>   module, and the options for that module. This is the definition of
>   a handler.
>
> - `notify: restart iis service` …and here is your latter. Finally!
>   The `notify` statement is the invocation of a handler by name.
>   Quite the reveal, we know. You already noticed that you’ve added a
>   `notify` statement to the `win_iis_website` task, now you know
>   why.

Section 4: Commit and Review
============================

Your new, improved playbook is done! But remember we still need to
commit the changes to source code control.

Click `File` → `Save All` to save the files you’ve written

![site.yml part 2](images/5-vscode-iis-yaml.png)

Click the Source Code icon (1), type in a commit message such as *Adding
advanced playbook* (2), and click the check box above (3).

![Commit site.yml](images/5-commit.png)

Sync to gitlab by clicking the arrows on the lower left blue bar. When
prompted, click `OK` to push and pull commits.

![Push to Gitlab.yml](images/5-push.png)

It should take 5-30 seconds to finish the commit. The blue bar should
stop rotating and indicate 0 problems…

Now let’s take a second look to make sure everything looks the way you
intended. If not, now is the time for us to fix it up. The figure below
shows line counts and spacing.

    - hosts: windows
      name: This is a play within a playbook
      vars:

            - http://{{ ansible_host }}:8081

      handlers:

            start_mode: auto

Section 5: Create your Job Template
===================================

Step 1:
-------

Before we can create our Job Template, you must first go resync your
Project again. So do that now.

> **Note**
>
> You must do this anytime you create a new *base* playbook file that
> you will be selecting via a Job Template. The new file must be synced
> to Tower before it will become available in the Job Template playbook
> dropdown.

Step 2:
-------

To test this playbook, we need to create a new Job Template to run this
playbook. So go to *Template* and click *Add* and select `Job Template`
to create a second job template.

Complete the form using the following values

| Key         | Value                      | Note |

Section 6: Running your new playbook
====================================

Now let’s run it and see how it works.

Step 1:
-------

Select TEMPLATES

> **Note**
>
> Alternatively, if you haven’t navigated away from the job templates
> creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

Step 2:
-------

Click the rocketship icon ![Add](images/at_launch_icon.png) for the
**IIS Advanced** Job Template.

Step 3:
-------

When prompted, enter your desired test message

After it launches, you should be redirected and can watch the output of
the job in real time.

When the job has successfully completed, you should see two URLs to your websites printed at the bottom of the job output.
