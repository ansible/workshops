# Objective

Demonstrate setup for Red Hat Ansible Tower.

# Guide

## Step 1:

Make sure Tower is successfully installed by logging into it.  Open up your web browser and type in the Ansible control node's IP address e.g. https://X.X.X.X.  This is the same IP address has provided by the instructor.

Login information:
- The username will be `admin`
- password provided by instructor

After logging in the Job Dashboard will be the default window as shown below.

## Step 2:

An inventory is required for Tower to be able to run jobs.  An Inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file. Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts. Groups may be sourced manually, by entering host names into Tower, or from one of Ansible Towerâ€™s supported cloud providers.  

>More info on Inventories in respect to Tower can be found in the [documentation here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html)

By default Tower has a **Demo Inventory** setup.  Click on the **Inventories** button under **Resources** on the left menu bar.  An animation is provided below:

## Step 3

Next, add the variables section `vars`. There will be one variable called `test_variable`.  The variable will have a string `"my test variable"`.

```yaml
---
- name: SIMPLE DEBUG PLAYBOOK
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    test_variable: "my test variable"
```

## Step 4

Next, add the first `task`. This task will use the `debug` module to print out the variable test_variable.

``` yaml
---
- name: SIMPLE DEBUG PLAYBOOK
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    test_variable: "my test variable"

  tasks:
    - name: DISPLAY TEST_VARIABLE
      debug:
        var: test_variable
```

>A play is a list of tasks. Tasks and modules have a 1:1 correlation.  Ansible modules are reusable, standalone scripts that can be used by the Ansible API, or by the ansible or ansible-playbook programs. They return information to ansible by printing a JSON string to stdout before exiting.

#### Step 5

Run the playbook - exit back into the command line of the control host and execute the following:

```
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook debug.yml
```
# Playbook Output

The output will look as follows.

```yaml
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook debug.yml

PLAY [SIMPLE DEBUG PLAYBOOK] *******************************************************************************

TASK [DISPLAY TEST_VARIABLE] *******************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "test_variable": "my test variable"
}

PLAY RECAP *************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

# Solution
The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here for an Answer key.

```yaml
---
- name: SIMPLE DEBUG PLAYBOOK
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    test_variable: "my test variable"

  tasks:
    - name: DISPLAY TEST_VARIABLE
      debug:
        var: test_variable
```
