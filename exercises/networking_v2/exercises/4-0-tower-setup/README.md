# Objective

Demonstrate setup for Red Hat Ansible Tower.  To run an Ansible Playbook in Tower we need to create a **Job Template**.  A **Job Template** requires:
 - An **Inventory** to run the job against
 - A **Credential** is used to login to devices.
 - A **Project** which contains Playbooks

# Guide

## Step 1: Tower Login

Make sure Tower is successfully installed by logging into it.  Open up your web browser and type in the Ansible control node's IP address e.g. https://X.X.X.X.  This is the same IP address has provided by the instructor.

Login information:
- The username will be `admin`
- password provided by instructor

After logging in the Job Dashboard will be the default window as shown below.

## Step 2: Setting up Inventory

An inventory is required for Tower to be able to run jobs.  An Inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file. In addition, Tower can make use of an existing configuration management data base (cmdb) such as ServiceNow or Infoblox DDI.

>More info on Inventories in respect to Tower can be found in the [documentation here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html)

By default Tower has a **Demo Inventory** setup.  Click on the **Inventories** button under **Resources** on the left menu bar.  An animation is provided below:

Instead of manually re-entering existing hosts into our Tower inventory it is possible to easily automate this with an Ansible Playbook.

```
---
- name: TOWER CONFIGURATION IN PLAYBOOK FORM
  hosts: routers
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:

    - name:  ADD HOST INTO TOWER INVENTORY
      tower_host:
        name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        inventory: "Workshop Inventory"
        tower_username: admin
        tower_password: ansible
        tower_host: https://localhost
        variables:
          ansible_network_os: "{{ansible_network_os}}"
          ansible_host: "{{ansible_host}}"
          ansible_user: "{{ansible_ssh_user}}"
          private_ip: "{{private_ip}}"
```

Create an Ansible Playbook called `tower_setup.yml`.  Cut and paste the above into the YML file with your text editor of choice.  To run the playbook use the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook tower_setup.yml
```

Now under the Inventories there will be two inventories, the `Demo Inventory` and the `Workshop Inventory`.  Under the `Workshop Inventory` click the **Hosts** button, there will be four routers, rtr1 through rtr4.  See the screenshot below:

## Step 3: Setting up a Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.  For the workshop we need a credential to authenticate to the network devices.

> For more information on Credentials in Tower please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html).

We can manually create this through the web UI or in this case, automate it using an Ansible Playbook.  For this task the [tower_credential module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/tower_credential_module.html) will be used. Append the following to the tower_setup.yml playbook.  

```yaml
    - name: ADD CREDENTIAL INTO TOWER
      tower_credential:
        name: Workshop Credential
        ssh_key_data: "/home/{{ansible_user}}/.ssh/aws-private.pem"
        kind: ssh
        organization: Default
        tower_username: admin
        tower_password: ansible
        tower_host: https://localhost
      run_once: true
      delegate_to: localhost
```

Re-run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command.

```
ansible-playbook tower_setup.yml
```

In the Tower UI, click on the Credentials link on the lefthand menu.  In addition to the default `Demo Credential` a new `Workshop Credential` will appear.

## Step 4: Setting up a Project

A project is how actually Playbooks are imported into Red Hat Ansible Tower.  You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually under the Project Base Path on your Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, including Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Red Hat Insights.  

> For more information on Projects in Tower, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/projects.html)

For this exercise we are going to use the already existing **linklight project** that the networking workshop is hosted on and turn it into a project in Tower.  For this particular task the [tower_project module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/tower_project_module.html) will be used. Append the following to the tower_setup.yml playbook.  

> Linklight is hosted on https://github.com/network-automation/linklight.

``` yaml
    - name: ADD LINKLIGHT REPO INTO TOWER
      tower_project:
        name: "Workshop Project"
        organization: "Default"
        scm_type: git
        scm_url: "https://github.com/network-automation/linklight"
        tower_username: admin
        tower_password: ansible
        tower_host: https://localhost
      run_once: true
      delegate_to: localhost
```

Re-run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command.

```
ansible-playbook tower_setup.yml
```

In the Tower UI, click on the Projects link on the lefthand menu.  In addition to the default `Demo Project` a new `Workshop Project` will appear.

#### Step 5: Creating a Job Template

Run the playbook - exit back into the command line of the control host and execute the following:

```
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook debug.yml
```
# Playbook Output

The output will look as follows.

```yaml
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook debug.yml

PLAY [SIMPLE DEBUG PLAYBOOK] *******************************************************************************

TASK [DISPLAY TEST_VARIABLE] *******************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "test_variable": "my test variable"
}

PLAY RECAP *************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

# Solution
The finished Ansible Playbook is provided here for an Answer key.

```yaml
---
- name: SIMPLE DEBUG PLAYBOOK
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    test_variable: "my test variable"

  tasks:
    - name: DISPLAY TEST_VARIABLE
      debug:
        var: test_variable
```
