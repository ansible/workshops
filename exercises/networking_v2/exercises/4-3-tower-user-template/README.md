# Objective

Demonstrate a vendor agnostic job template for user creation.  This job will configure a specified user through a survey.

This exercise will differ from the previous exercise by automating the creation of the survey.  We will use a supplied survey specification file (`user.json`) along with the [tower_job_template module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/tower_job_template_module.html) to quickly provision the job into Ansible Tower.

# Guide

## Step 1:

Make sure you are on the control node cli. Using your favorite text editor (`vim` and `nano` are available on the control host) create a new file called `userjob.yml`.

```
---
- name: TOWER CONFIGURATION IN PLAYBOOK FORM
  hosts: ansible
  connection: local
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:

    - name: CREATE USER JOB TEMPLATE
      tower_job_template:
        name: "CONFIGURE USER"
        job_type: "run"
        inventory: "Workshop Inventory"
        project: "Workshop Project"
        playbook: "network_user.yml"
        credential: "Workshop Credential"
        survey_enabled: true
        survey_spec: "{{ lookup('template', '{{playbook_dir}}/user.json') }}"
        tower_username: admin
        tower_password: ansible
        tower_host: https://localhost
```

## Step 2:

Launch the job with the `ansible-playbook` command.

## Step 3

Click the Jobs button the left menu.

The Jobs link displays a list of jobs and their statusâ€“shown as completed successfully or failed, or as an active (running) job. Actions you can take from this screen include viewing the details and standard output of a particular job, relaunch jobs, or remove jobs.

The **BACKUP NETWORK CONFIG** job was the most recent (unless you have been launching more jobs).  Click on this job to return to the **Job Details View**.  Tower will save the history of every job launched and it is possible to see down to the task level of what happened on a particular job.

# Solution
You have finished this exercise.  

You have
 - created a job template for backing up network configurations
 - launched the job template from the Ansible Tower UI
 - looked under the covers on the control node to see where the Playbooks are being stored
