In this exercise, we will learn how to configure and perform an OpenSCAP scan using playbooks in Ansible Automation Platform 2 with Satellite.

When running multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, it's important to keep all of these systems compliant with a meaningful security policy and perform security scans often.
OpenSCAP is an open source project that defines the language used to express compliance checklists in human and machine readable form (XML). 
Government agencies, corporations, and e-commerce organizations, for example, provide their compliance checklists using OpenSCAP.
The OpenSCAP project also develops tools for automated compliance checking.
Red Hat Satellite is configured with openscap integration enabled by default. 
This installs openscap ansible modules, roles, and related tools. Satellite is also loaded with the SCAP security guide (SSG)(scap-seruity-guide.noarch). 
The SSG contains the checklist files for multiple standards, for multiple operating systems and releases. 
These checklists allow for scanning systems to evaluate benchmarks for like CIS, PCI, HIPPA, Justice and DISA-STIG compliance. 

The SCAP packages are available with every install of RHEL. 
You can also install the RPM package for the SCAP workbench (e.g. scap-workbench.x86_64) which provides the ability to load and examine the checklists in a user friendly GUI. 
You can create a tailoring file for any of the included profiles that allows you to turn on or turn off specific checks to meet the your organization's unique requirements. You can launch and test scans based on your profiles using the tool. 
Your tailoring files and the profile can be loaded into Satellite and assigned to groups of systems customize scanning and reporting. Satellite produces reports to meet audit specifications.

This exercise will focus on standard profiles for PCI and DISA STIG for RHEL systems. Tailoring and other operating systems will be out of scope.

#### 6\. Navigate back to Satellite to examine the Asset Reporting File (ARF).

-   Switch to the browser tab with the Satellite UI and hover over 'Hosts' from the side pane menu and then click on 'Reports'.

![aap_arf](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_ARF.png)

-   Click on the 'Full Report' button, under Actions, for 'node1.example.com' to see the report (This may take a few seconds). The Openscap Capsule field will reflect your workshop Satellite host.

-   Scroll down to the **Rule Overview** section. You can filter by "Pass", "Fail", "Fixed", or any number of qualifiers as well as group rules by "Severity"

![aap_arf](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_ARF.png)

> **NOTE:**
> *Firefox browser* - Currently Firefox browsers are unable to display the Rule Overview filters.

-   Selecting a rule presents detailed information regarding rationale as well as a description of the rule that includes references and identifiers.
-   Uncheck everything except the *fail* checkbox. For the "Group rules by" drop down menu, select "Severity".

![aap_arf](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_ARF1.png)

- Scroll down and click on the failure "Prevent Login to Accounts With Empty Password".

- If you scroll the page you will notice multiple remediation option selections in green, including a 'Remediate Ansible snippet'.
Click "Activate to reveal" arrow next to the 'Remediation Ansible snippet', which then presents Ansible tasks you can include within a playbook to automate remediation across affected systems.

![aap_arf](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_ARF2.png)

#### 7\. Expanding OpenSCAP policy scans

This step will expand our OpenSCAP policy scan to add another XCCDF compliance profile called ```STIG_Compliance```. We will also expand to include all systems in the 'RHEL7 Development' inventory by leaving the job run ```limit survey``` blank instead of specifying a single system.

-   In Satellite, hover over "Hosts" from the menu on the left side of the screen, and then click on "Policies".

-   Click on the "New Compliance Policy" button

-   Select "Manual" from the deployment options and click "Next"

![satellite_policy](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_SCAP6.png)

-   Create the policy name "STIG_Compliance" and provide any description you like. Then click "Next"

![satellite_policy](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_SCAP7.png)

-   Select the "Red Hat rhel7 default content" and "DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7". There is no tailoring file. Then click "Next"

![satellite_policy](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_SCAP8.png)

-   It is necessary to set a schedule when creating a new compliance policy. You can select "Monthly" and "1" for Day of Month for the purposes of this exercise. Then click "Next"

![satellite_policy](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_SCAP9.png)

-   Steps 5, 6, and 7 as part of the New Compliance Policy can use default values. Click "Next" through "Locations", "Organizations", and "Hostgroups". On "Hostgroups" click "Submit" to create the policy.

![satellite_policy](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_SCAP10.png)

- After clicking "Submit", you will be presented with the Compliance Policies view, where the new ```STIG_Compliance``` policy is listed, along with the ```PCI_Compliance``` policy created earlier in the exercise.

![satellite_policy](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_Compliance_Policies2.png)

-   Now, we will update our OpenSCAP Scan job template in Ansible Automation Platform and run another PCI compliance scan, plus the STIG compliance scan.
-   Navigate back to the Ansible Automation Platform UI and click 'Templates' from the left side pane menu
-   Select the OpenSCAP Scan job template, and click edit at the bottom of the template to modify the "Variables" section and add the ```STIG_Compliance``` policy to the ```policy_name``` list:

        Variables (Keep the exact spacing provided below.
        Note that the extra-vars that we are supplying need to be
        in YAML format):

        ---
        policy_name:
          - PCI_Compliance
          - STIG_Compliance

![aap_template](images/1-compliance-aap2-template2-fix.png)

-   Leave the rest of the fields blank or as they are, and click 'Save'. You can then select 'Launch' to deploy the job template.

-   On the survey, leave the Limit field empty, as we are going to target all instances in the inventory group and click Next. For "Select inventory group", leave the default selection for "RHEL7_Dev" and click Next. Review the entries on the launch Preview and notice scrolling down confirms the entries made during the survey. Click "Launch".
-   You will be presented with ```Jobs[SATELLITE / Compliance - OpenSCAP Scan]``` output window. This will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Wait for the job template to complete before proceeding to the next step.

![aap_output](images/1-compliance-aap2-OpenSCAP_Configure-output2-fix.png)

#### 8\. Navigate back to Satellite to examine the Asset Reporting File (ARF).

-   Switch to the browser tab with the Satellite UI and hover over "Hosts" from the menu on the left side of the screen, and then click on "Reports".

-   Notice that we've now easily scaled to six policy scans, with each node being scanned for the ```PCI_Compliance``` policy and for ```STIG_Compliance``` policy.

![aap_arf](images/1-compliance-aap2-Satellite_ARF-Final.png)

-   Each report can be reviewed independent of other node scans and remediations for rule findings can be completed according to the requirements of your own internal policies.

#### 9\. End of Exercise

-   You have finished Exercise 1.
-   Continue to [Exercise 2: Patch Management / OS](../2-patching/README.md), OR [Return to the main workshop page](../README.md)
