## Use Cases

This workshop currently focuses on 5 main customer pain points:
- Compliance (OpenSCAP Scanning) and Vulnerability Management
- Patch/Package Management
- CentOS/OracleLinux to RHEL Conversion
- RHEL In-Place-Upgrades
- Vulnerability Management with Insights

## Presentations

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the participants through the entire lab. All concepts are explained when they are introduced.

There is an optional presentation available to support the workshops and explain Automation, the basics of Ansible and the topics of the exercises in more detail.  Workshop presentation is located at [Automated Satellite Workshop](https://aap2.demoredhat.com/decks/ansible_auto_satellite.pdf).

Also have a look at our Ansible Best Practices Deck:

## Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on multiple factors: the number of participants, how familiar those are with Linux in general and how much discussions are done in between.

Having said that, the exercises themselves should take roughly 4 to 5 hours. Compliance, Patching and Insights exercises each take roughly 30-45 minutes. OS Conversion and RHEL In-Place-Upgrade each require about an hour to complete. The accompanying presentation itself adds 45 minutes to an hour if included in whole.
