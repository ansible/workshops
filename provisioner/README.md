# Ansible AWS training provisioner
**aws_lab_setup** is an automated lab setup for Ansible training on AWS (Amazon Web Services).  There are currently three modes:
 - [Ansible Engine Workshop](../exercises/ansible_engine) for demonstrating Ansible capabilities on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
 - [Ansible Networking Workshop](../exercises/networking) for demonstrating Ansible’s capabilities on network equipment (e.g. Cisco Systems IOS).
 - [Ansible F5 Workshop](../exercises/ansible_f5) for demonstrating Ansible’s capabilities on F5 BIG-IP

## Setup (per workshop)

1. Define the following variables in a file passed in using `-e @extra_vars.yml`

```
---
ec2_region: us-east-1                  # region where the nodes will live
ec2_name_prefix: TESTWORKSHOP          # name prefix for all the VMs
student_total: 2                       # creates student_total of workbenches for the workshop
#OPTIONAL VARIABLES
admin_password: ansible                # password for Ansible control node, defaults to ansible
networking: true                       # Set this if you want the workshop in networking mode
create_login_page: true                # creates AWS S3 website for ec2_name_prefix.workshop_dns_zone
workshop_dns_zone: rhdemo.io           # Sets the Route53 DNS zone to use for the S3 website
towerinstall: true                     # automatically installs Tower to control node
#autolicense: true                     # automatically licenses Tower if license is provided
#xrdp: true                            # install xrdp with xfce for graphical interface
```

If you want to license it you must copy a license called tower_license.json into this directory.  If you do not have a license already please request one using the [Workshop License Link](https://www.ansible.com/workshop-license).

For more extra_vars examples, look at the following:
- [sample-vars.yml](sample_workshops/sample-vars.yml) - example for the Ansible Engine Workshop
- [sample-vars-networking.yml](sample_workshops/sample-vars-networking.yml) - example for the **Ansible Network Workshop**
- [sample-vars-f5.yml](sample_workshops/sample-vars-f5.yml) - example for **Ansible F5 Workshop**
- [sample-vars-auto.yml](sample_workshops/sample-vars-auto.yml) - example for Tower installation and licensing

2. Run the playbook:

        ansible-playbook provision_lab.yml -e @extra_vars.yml

3. Login to the EC2 console and you should see instances being created like:

        `TESTWORKSHOP-student1-ansible`

## Accessing student documentation and slides

  - Exercises and instructor slides are hosted at http://ansible.com/linklight
  - Workbench information is stored in two places after you provision:
    - in a local directory named after the workshop (e.g. TESTWORKSHOP/instructor_inventory)
    - if `create_login_page: true` is enabled, there will be a website ec2_name_prefix.workshop_dns_zone (e.g. TESTWORKSHOP.rhdemo.io)

# Lab Teardown

The `teardown_lab.yml` playbook deletes all the training instances as well as local inventory files.

To destroy all the EC2 instances after training is complete:

1. Run the playbook:

        ansible-playbook teardown_lab.yml -e @extra_vars.yml
