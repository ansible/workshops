# FIXME: This can be found dynamically via a rpm query, but there's little use
#        since there's no yum repo and we have to install a specific version by
#        hand anyways.
#
#        For good measure, this is the query:
#
#           rpm -q snort --queryformat='%{version}' | sed 's/\.//g'
