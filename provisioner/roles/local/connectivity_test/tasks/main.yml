- name: Wait 400 seconds (using wait_for_connection)
  wait_for_connection:
    delay: 0
    timeout: 400

# This wait_for_connection task can't be part of manage_ec2_instances
# because you can't use groups with delegate_to, see:
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35195
# also the meta refresh_inventory won't help, as its intended for dynamic inventory
