# External roles must be called with include_role:
#  1. Ansible validates that roles exists before execution,
#     therefore if the role is not already installed it fails, giving
#     no opportunity to solve role dependencies in the same playbook.
#  2. By calling as include, the check is done dynamically at execution,
#     so the galaxy play can solve all dependencies before ansible start
#     processing the include_role.
