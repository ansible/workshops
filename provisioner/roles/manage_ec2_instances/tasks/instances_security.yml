# The CheckPoint GW
#
# This AWS Appliance Image requires all Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) to be
# present at instance creation time because there does not appear to be
# a post-instantiation way to add it because the CPGW does not feature
# a standard GNU userspace but instead an embedded linux style setup with
# limited availability to modify the instance after creation (in testing we
# found that even rebooting the instance with new ENIs attached did not cause
# them to be added.
