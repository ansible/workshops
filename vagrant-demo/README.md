# Directions

Please follow the [vagrant setup instructions](../README.md) before switching to the Arista lab.

1. Download Arista Vagrant image

   Go to arista.com, make an account if you have not already, and click the Support->Software Downloads ![screenshot](download.png)

2. Add the box image to Vagrant

   Use the `vagrant box add` command on the newly downloaded box image.  Make sure to use the `--name` parameter and name the box image `veos`.

       ```bash
       ➜  user@rhel7:-$ vagrant box add vEOS-lab-4.20.1F-virtualbox.box --name veos
       ==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
       ==> box: Adding box 'veos' (v0) for provider:
           box: Unpacking necessary files from:        file:///Users/sean/Documents/GitHub/linklight/vagrant-demo/arista/vEOS-lab-4.20.1F-virtualbox.box
       ==> box: Successfully added box 'veos' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!
       ➜  user@rhel7:-$
       ```

   NOTE: If you are having trouble, please refer to [Arista's official documentation](https://eos.arista.com/using-veos-with-vagrant-and-virtualbox/).

3.  Vagrant up the topology

   Use the `vagrant up` command to bring up the topology

       ```
       ➜  user@rhel7:-$ vagrant up ansible leaf01 leaf02 spine01 spine02
       ```

4. Try connecting to an individual switch

   From the same directory as the Vagrantfile, use the `vagrant ssh` command to connect to the device.  To connect directly to the Arista CLI use the `-c FastCli` parameter

       ```➜  user@rhel7:-$ vagrant ssh leaf01 -c FastCli
       leaf01>
       ```

5. Open up the Lab exercises

   Open up the [labs](./labs) directory
