# Lab 1 - Using Ansible to gather data from network devices

In the first lab you will learn to use Ansible to gather lots of
useful information about a test network. You will create a
**playbook** containing a list of tasks.

> A playbook can have multiple plays and a play can have one or more tasks. Tasks are the smallest unit within playbooks. Each task executes using a _module_. Modules typically take parameters as user inputs.
