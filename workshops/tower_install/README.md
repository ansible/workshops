# Workshop: Installing Tower

### Topics Covered

* Installing Ansible Tower
* Importing a License File

### What You Will Learn

* The installation process for a standalone instance of Ansible Tower using the bundled installer.

### The Assignment

Install Ansible Tower on your controller machine using the [latest installer](http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz) and upload your license file. 

1. Follow the [quick installation instructions](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/index.html) to configure and run the single integrated installation of Ansible Tower on the control machine.
2. Sign into the Ansible Tower UI and upload the license file to enable the instance when prompted. Request a trial license if one hasn't been provided already. (Either trial license type will suffice for these lab assignments.)

### Extra Credit

* After importing the license file, access the ping API endpoint using a browser.
